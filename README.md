[Web Intent](http://webintents.org) handler to view RSS and Atom feeds as pretty-printed XML.

It handles the `view` intent for feeds (the `application/atom+xml` and `application/rss+xml` types). The passed in feed is displayed as pretty-printed XML. Developers that use Chrome 20 or later may find this useful when trying to view raw feed data.

Available [in the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oceapojkdgeophkjdijkpbjifdnfimdh).
